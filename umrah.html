    <section id="sahabiyas">
        <h2>How Sahabiyas Performed Umrah</h2>
        <p>The companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), especially the women (Sahabiyas), played a crucial role in exemplifying the righteous practices of Islam, including the performance of Umrah. Their dedication to fulfilling the rites of Umrah with sincerity and devotion is an inspiring model for Muslim women today. The following are detailed accounts of some Sahabiyas who performed Umrah, including the wisdom they imparted through their actions, Hadiths, and the significance of their experiences in the context of Islamic teachings regarding women’s participation in religious rites.</p>
    
        <h3>1. Umm Salama (RA) and Her Umrah Journey</h3>
        <p>Umm Salama (RA) was one of the most revered and intelligent companions of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). She was known for her deep understanding of Islamic teachings and her commitment to the faith. Her journey to perform Umrah is one of the most notable accounts involving a woman.</p>
    
        <p>On one occasion, Umm Salama (RA) expressed concern about leaving her home for Umrah. She felt hesitant and was unsure whether it was the right time to undertake this sacred journey. The Prophet (PBUH) reassured her, telling her that performing Umrah would bring her spiritual blessings and relieve her concerns. He said:</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"O Umm Salama, perform your Umrah with sincerity, and know that Allah (SWT) will accept it." (Sunan Ibn Majah)</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>Umm Salama (RA) then traveled and performed the rites of Umrah with full devotion, offering a beautiful example of how women, like men, can partake in religious duties with sincerity and trust in Allah. Upon returning, she spoke about the peace and spiritual renewal she felt, emphasizing the power of faith and reliance on Allah’s mercy.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Aisha (RA) and Her Experience with Umrah</h3>
        <p>Aisha (RA), the beloved wife of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), has several recorded instances of performing Umrah during her lifetime. One of the most significant events involving Aisha (RA) and Umrah occurred after her menstruation during the Hajj in the 7th year of Hijrah.</p>
    
        <p>According to a Hadith narrated by Aisha (RA) herself:</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I was in a state of menstruation when we went for the Hajj. I was distressed because I was unable to perform Tawaf and Sa’i. But the Prophet (PBUH) said to me: 'Do everything that the pilgrims do except Tawaf, until you are purified.'" (Sahih Bukhari)</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>This incident highlights the flexibility of Islamic rituals in accommodating the natural cycles of women. Aisha (RA) was reassured by the Prophet (PBUH) that her menstruation did not disqualify her from performing the rest of the Umrah rituals once she was purified. This ruling continues to serve as an important reminder that menstruating women are not excluded from performing the rituals of Hajj and Umrah, as long as they follow the prescribed guidelines.</p>
    
        <h3>3. Safiya bint Huyayy (RA) and Her Umrah</h3>
        <p>Safiya bint Huyayy (RA), the wife of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), had the distinction of being one of the few women who traveled with the Prophet (PBUH) during his expeditions. After the conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions were preparing for the Umrah, Safiya (RA) accompanied him. This incident underscores the importance of the companionship and involvement of women in the religious activities of the time.</p>
    
        <p>When they were about to perform Tawaf, Safiya (RA) began to menstruate. The Prophet (PBUH) noticed her distress and immediately reassured her, saying:</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <p>"This is a situation in which you have nothing to be distressed about. It will not prevent you from performing the rituals. Perform your Umrah, and Allah (SWT) will reward you for your efforts." (Sahih Bukhari)</p>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>This Hadith reflects the Prophet’s compassion and understanding toward women, especially in regard to natural occurrences like menstruation, which should not hinder a woman’s spiritual journey or sense of participation in religious rites.</p>
    
        <h3>4. Fatima bint Qais (RA) and Her Umrah</h3>
        <p>Fatima bint Qais (RA), one of the noble women of the early Muslim community, also undertook the journey of Umrah. She was well-known for her devotion and wisdom. One of her significant experiences involved her performing Umrah during her lifetime, where she actively participated in the rites, showing the active role of women in religious practices.</p>
    
        <p>In her narration, Fatima (RA) described the Prophet's (PBUH) guidance on the importance of performing the rituals correctly, emphasizing the significance of following the prescribed steps and maintaining one’s focus on Allah throughout the entire journey. Her testimony encourages women today to maintain their piety, to seek knowledge, and to perform the rituals of Umrah with full sincerity.</p>
    
        <h3>5. The Role of Women in Umrah – General Guidelines and Wisdom</h3>
        <p>The stories of these Sahabiyas provide us with important lessons on the role of women in performing Umrah and other religious duties. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) never restricted women from participating in the rites of Hajj or Umrah. He encouraged women to be part of the spiritual journeys and emphasized the importance of their role in fulfilling religious obligations.</p>
    
        <h2>Key Lessons from Sahabiyas' Umrah Experiences:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Women Can Perform Umrah with Full Devotion:</strong> Women, just like men, are encouraged to perform Umrah as an expression of their faith, with no restrictions based on gender. The stories of Umm Salama, Aisha, and others demonstrate that the spiritual reward for performing Umrah is not limited by gender.</li>
           <br> <li><strong>Guidance for Menstruating Women:</strong> Menstruating women can perform most of the rituals of Umrah, except Tawaf around the Ka'bah, until they are purified. This has been clearly demonstrated through the stories of Aisha (RA) and Safiya (RA), highlighting the understanding and flexibility within Islamic jurisprudence concerning women’s natural cycles.</li>
           <br>   <li><strong>Women Traveling Alone:</strong> While it was common for women to travel with male guardians or companions, women like Umm Salama (RA) were also able to embark on their Umrah journeys independently, highlighting the importance of women’s agency in fulfilling religious duties.</li>
           <br>  <li><strong>Spiritual Rejuvenation:</strong> Just as the Sahabiyas found spiritual renewal through their journeys, modern Muslim women are also encouraged to approach Umrah as a means of enhancing their closeness to Allah, deepening their spirituality, and finding peace.</li>
        </ul>
    
        
        <p >The stories of the Sahabiyas’ experiences during Umrah are a testament to the importance of women in the practice of Islam. They demonstrate that spiritual pursuits such as Umrah are equally accessible to women, and their participation is not only permitted but encouraged in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Today, these stories serve as a source of inspiration and guidance for Muslim women undertaking the pilgrimage, showing them that they too can fully partake in the rites with sincerity, devotion, and unwavering faith in Allah.</p>
